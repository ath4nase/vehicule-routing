# vehicule-routing

This report present multiple algorithms responding to two problems, first,
elementary shortest path, then, vehicle routing problem with time windows. The
elementary shortest path problem is solved with dynamic programming and tree
search algorithms. The vehicle routing problem is solved with two algorithm
based on column generation
